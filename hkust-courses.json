In the past decade, however, several new solar cell technologies based on organic materials are emerging as promising alternatives to conventional solar cells.  This is an exciting and highly interdisciplinary area involving Chemistry, Physics, Materials Science, and Electronic Engineering. The study on organic solar cells provides an excellent platform for Science and Engineering students to learn about how to do research in a multidisciplinary environment. Another key focus of this course is to improve students' communication and interview skills through in-class presentations and group discussions on cutting-edge technologies.",

In weekly large-class settings, students will work with an economics instructor on interpreting and explaining data, applying economic principles to daily life, building and supporting an argument, and evaluating different perspectives in scholarly debates. In weekly small-group tutorials, a language instructor will lead discussions to analyse texts and workshop individual students’ writing. At the end of the course students will be better prepared to undertake independent research and writing in their economics coursework, as well as to write from an economics perspective for a range of non-academic purposes.

Through hands on work with a simple but fully functional wireless communication system, you will understand the basic engineering tools used and tradeoffs encountered in the design of these systems.  This course is centered on weekly laboratories, each designed to introduce an important concept in the design of these systems.  The lab sessions are supported by two one-hour lectures and a tutorial that introduce the concepts for the next laboratory, as well as reviewing and expanding the concepts learned in the previous laboratory.",

The goal of this course is to develop students’ communication, interpersonal, teamwork, analytical, design and project management skills through a multi‐disciplinary, team‐based design experience. The design thinking process modules: empathize, define, ideate, prototype and test, will be introduced and the students will learn experientially by applying these process modules to solve the health unmet needs they observe in real life. The students are required to report their progress throughout the semester. At the end of the course, they will showcase their prototype in a roadshow and submit their project report and reflection on their design journey. It is a common core course for students from different schools who have no background in design thinking or are looking for practical experience in design thinking.",

Through small group discussions, in-class activities, personal reflections and individual coaching, this course teaches students to use design thinking to explore many of life’s major challenges, such as pursuing careers they love and finding personal fulfillment. Topics include the integration of work and worldviews, ideation techniques, a portfolio approach to thriving, designing to increase balance and energy and how to prototype all aspects of students’ life. The course also touches on the realities of engaging the workplace, and practices that support vocation formation throughout the career of students. The capstone assignment is the creation of an “Odyssey Plan” focusing on taking actions in the 3-5 years following their graduation. For Engineering students only. Graded P or F.",

While viable benchmarks and concepts for sustainable development exist, economic decision-makers and financial institutions by and large still focus on economic profit, leaving environmental and societal sustainability outside of their cost-benefit assessments.\nIn order to provide an alternative approach that guides financial investment towards green ventures, the course offers insights into sustainable development concepts and respective assessment mechanisms for sustainable corporate performance. These concepts and mechanisms are exemplified in the Circular Economy (CE) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), which constitute increasingly important elements in sustainable development. By adopting a multidisciplinary perspective, the classes cover the fundamentals of sustainable concepts, benchmarks on how to measure sustainable performance in the economic domain (i.e., at the corporate-, meso- and system-level) and empirical cases on how green finance has and can make a difference to promote sustainable growth.",

Amidst the emergence of greenwashing practices that falsely claim environmental preferability, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Carbon Footprinting have become essential tools for providing quantitative evidence of a product's or system's environmental and social impact. This course takes a systems-thinking approach to sustainability issues and explores the application of LCA in a range of areas, including technology development, environmental reporting, investment, and policymaking. By doing so, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of the impact of products and systems over their entire life cycle and learn how to make informed decisions to achieve sustainability goals. The course teaches students the concepts, methodology, and software skills needed to conduct LCA projects and interpret LCA reports. Students will be equipped to apply LCA to promote sustainable development in various contexts.",

    "description": "This course will help students adapt to university life through advising, sharing and discussion, and applying the science of well‐being to enhance their personal and interpersonal development. It also aims to foster their self‐understanding and confidence as young adults who can fully enjoy their university education and career thereafter. The course has 3 components: Lectures and Seminars, Self‐Directed Experience, and Advising and Community Meetings. Lectures and Seminars will orientate students to their respective Schools/IPO, provide academic advice and equip them with the scientific bases of well‐being. Self‐Directed Experience will provide opportunities to develop mindsets and habits for students’ physical and social‐emotional wellness and personal enrichment. In Advising and Community Meetings, students will bring knowledge and skills together through reflection and discussion with peers and School/IPO advisors. Topics such as learning and time management skills, purpose of university education, and planning for personal and professional development will be covered. Graded PP, P or F.",

Language use, an integral part of human communication, mirrors the inextricably entangled psychological, social, and cultural facets of human cognition and interaction. Building upon a fundamental exploration of the nature of human languages, this course will delve into the closely interlinked notions of language, communication and society as manifested in our daily life, in the context of globalization and increasing border-crossing and intercultural exchanges. Through a lingua-cultural lens, we will probe a range of issues rooted in language and culture: language and thought; identities, self and 'othering'; cultural diversity in verbal and nonverbal communication; language, gender and sexuality; popular culture and global cultural flow; language and power; globalization and language planning and policy in different cultural contexts. Through discussions of such, the course aims to cultivate an appreciation and respect for linguistic and cultural diversity, communicative sensitivity, and social equality.",

This course is in chronological order, beginning from Republican women to contemporary female immigrants in the age of globalization. The changing images of women on screen went hand in hand with major cinematic movements in history, including the left turn in the 1930s, the rise of animation, socialist filmmaking, model opera film, underground/independent filmmaking, and the cinematic globalization. The purpose of this course is to build a foundation for students from different academic backgrounds who may have little or no knowledge of Chinese culture and history. Proficiency in Chinese is a plus but not required because all reading materials and class discussion are in English.",

This course will study the internal and external tensions that undermined the traditional orders, compelling China, Japan, and Korea to seek new political and social reforms. Special attention will be given to the revolutionary changes in society, thought, culture, and the rise of a new political order in twentieth-century China, Japan, and Korea.",

A holistic perspective on community and heritage highlighting the interdependence and interrelatedness of the ecological and environmental aspects, technological and economic aspects, social and political aspects, and cultural and cosmological aspects will be introduced to enhance students' understanding of interdisciplinary learning in real life contexts and stimulate their exploration and creativity. Real life experiential learning will be substantiated with laboratory sessions on food technology analysis and classroom lectures on relevant conceptual frameworks to explore critical issues about heritage preservation, tourism development and community revitalization. Critical reflections will be guided to synthesize the various experiential learning components in classroom and real life contexts.",

How to identify and interpret place names, objects, peoples and animals depicted in the maps, and how to distinguish the real from the imaginary? Who made these maps, for whom, and for what purposes? How were the images of China produced by Chinese different from those by European cartographers?",

This is a world which is a product of mobility of people, information and products across physical and virtual boundaries. Languages themselves are changed through migration. Within a context of linguistic diversity, language is central to the organization of institutions, access to information, the exchange of goods and the ability to communicate. Students will investigate how language is used by migrants in areas including health, education, the law and employment. They will explore how language practices are shaped by face-to-face and mediated encounters and by the constraints of political and institutional contexts. Key questions are: What languages and forms of communication get used, when, why and where? What linguistic factors enable and limit access for migrants to services and resources? What are the consequences?",

Students learn about fundamental design theories, principles, and methods through a project-based learning approach. Students then experience several stages of a creative design process. The process begins by asking students to identify real-world problems through social, business, scientific, and technological perspectives. To add specificity, students will be able to describe the behaviors and needs of social interactions, observe demographic phenomena, assess business viability, and identify and understand technological changes and impacts, etc. After defining a problem statement, students will be guided to generate creative solutions using brainstorming tools and creative thinking skills. Selected solutions will be presented in form of prototypes and open for user feedback. This course emphasizes the appreciation of the role and significance of design for our society.",

Students will be given resource and time constraints to complete project milestones under the supervision of a faculty advisor. Regular project meetings will be held to track progress. Each student in a group will be responsible to lead one key element for a successful outcome. A first semester final presentation will update faculty advisors, other ISD faculty and mentors on the project progress and future development plans. Instructor's approval is required for enrollment in the course.",

    "description": "This course seeks to equip students with persuasive communication skills, both oral and written, through analyzing business cases and presenting solutions to problems identified. It provides students with a solid framework and hands-on practice to communicate persuasively and professionally in business settings. In presenting the case problem, analysis and recommendations, students learn to identify issues, develop and organize key ideas, and eventually to persuade the audience of the validity of the arguments and proposed actions. The course sharpens students' ability to explain and support ideas logically, coherently and cohesively using various techniques, to communicate clearly, concisely and accurately, and in appropriate tone and style. Through a range of learning activities involving reading, discussion, writing and making oral presentations, students also develop critical reading, critical thinking and problem solving skills as well as teamwork and leadership skills. For students who have this course as a program requirement.",

The course introduces students to research skills using university library resources for finding and evaluating sources for academic writing and speaking tasks. It expects students to be critical readers and writers, synthesizing ideas when developing a coherent argument. The course also aims to develop students’ competence in communicating effectively in an academic community, developing the ability to collaborate both as a member of a group and assuming responsibility as a discussion facilitator in the context of student-led seminars. Throughout the course, students are expected to transfer and adapt their knowledge, attitudes and habits for autonomous lifelong learning.",

Later parts of this course cover selected advanced topics such as local limits of random walks, mixing/cutoff phenomena, or directed polymers. Some familiarity with measure-theoretic probability theory (as in MATH 5411) is helpful, but not strictly necessary to follow this course.

In this course, we will explain the enabling materials science and engineering behind advanced energy technologies by answering questions such as why lithium powers our batteries and why it takes silicon to make a solar panel. Major material challenges of emerging energy technologies will also be discussed. During the course, the students will be exposed to 1) the knowledge of material structure-property correlations used in energy technologies, 2) materials synthesis and fabrication techniques for their incorporation into energy devices, and 3) material evaluation principles in energy applications. After taking the course, students will be able to identify desirable material properties and potentially propose new materials and manufacturing methods for specific energy technologies.",

Scientific evidence suggests that our decisions are often biased and flawed, resulting in disappointing or even disastrous outcomes. This course draws upon contemporary research in psychology and other social sciences to better understand how it is that people make decisions, and why those decisions are often made badly. The course will emphasize a theoretical understanding of human decision making, as well as a comprehension of the real world implications of our mistakes both for us and for our society, and what, if anything, can be done about it.",

    "description": "This course presents and exemplifies three major traditions of ethical thought in East and West moral philosophy - namely utilitarianism, principle-based ethics and virtue-based ethics. Employing guest speakers, lectures, cases, contemporary readings, role-plays, fieldwork, reflective student writing, and discussion groups, the course engages students in a serious consideration of their own ethical standards as applied to their present academic environment and their future careers. Students come to understand through this course that while an ethical dilemma may be viewed in various ways depending on one's guiding assumptions, a decision and course of action nevertheless must be chosen in harmony with one's own moral convictions. For Business students only.",

The course covers decisions of international courts and arbitral tribunals that affect the activities and governance of private and state-owned multinational corporations. Students will learn how companies can minimize the impact of problematic situations through arbitration, mediation, and alternative means of dispute settlement. The understanding of key legal concepts that govern cross-border trade and investment ensures a holistic preparation to management and business students and enables them to better address complex issues that companies face in a globalised economy.",

    "description": "Large language models (LLMs) have utterly transformed the field of natural language processing (NLP) in the last 3-4 years. These relevant foundation models are becoming ubiquitous in solving a wide range of tasks not limited to natural language understanding, notably in generation tasks in computer vision, for instance. These models on the other hand have given rise to new ethical and scalability challenges. This course aims to cover contemporary LLM topics centering around pre-trained language models (BERT, GPT, T5 models, mixture-of-expert models, retrieval-based models), emerging capabilities (knowledge, reasoning, few-shot learning, in-context learning, computer vision), fine-tuning and adaptation, as well as security and ethics. We will cover each topic and discuss important papers in depth. Students will be expected to read and present research papers and complete a research project at the end, in a group of 2-3 students. This is an advanced graduate course and all the students are expected to have taken machine learning and preferably NLP courses, and should be familiar with deep learning models such as Transformers.",

    "description": "The course is designed to strengthen students’ competence in teaching. It comprises 2 parts: Part 1 aims to equip all full-time research postgraduate (RPg) students with basic teaching skills before assuming teaching assistant duties for the department. Good teaching skills can be acquired through learning and practice.  This 10-hour mandatory training course provides all graduate teaching assistants (GTA) with the necessary theoretical knowledge with practical opportunities to apply and build up their knowledge, skills and confidence in taking up their teaching duties. At the end of the course, GTAs should be able to (1) facilitate teaching in tutorials and laboratory settings; (2) provide meaningful feedback to their students; and (3) design an active learning environment to engage their students. In Part 2, students are required to perform instructional delivery assigned by their respective departments to complete this course. MPhil students are required to give at least one 30-minute session of instructional delivery in front of a group of students for one term. PhD students are required to give at least one such session each in two different terms. Graded PP, P or F.",

Movies illustrate human lives and feelings in a dramatic way, which often allows us to experience historical events or lives in the other side of the world indirectly. The purpose of this course is to provide an overview of the field of political science and key events in political history by watching movies describing them. Often political concepts such as state, democracy, dictatorship, repression and protest, representation, and election, are considered too abstract or too complicated. Addressing those concepts through movies will allow students to understand those concepts with living examples and empathy. The course explores important political topics and themes including political power and election, democracy, protest and repression, media, corruption, and war. By watching movies, attending lectures, and participating in discussions, students not only learn these concepts but also understand that political issues are part of our society and history and have a substantial influence on individual's life.",

It encourages students to apply the knowledge of democracy learnt in class to critically evaluate existing political systems and diverse social issues that they face in everyday life. Through in-depth examination of democracy as a normative value, this course will also encourage students to reflect the implications of democracy as a theory to various practical socio-political issues in today’s world.",

This is an age in which we tend to explain human behavior in terms of our individual achievements, personalities, and even our genetic make-up. The sociologist, however, looks at human behavior as the product of groups, organizations and culture. In order to master this sociological outlook, the course shall examine a number of topics central to our lives from the point of view of sociological perspectives and methods. These topics will include: culture, deviance, inequality, religion, education, social change and development, gender, intimate relations and the family, and power and politics.",

Usually, this involves a set of assumptions or substantive factual information about how the natural world produced the data.

The study of culture is highly interdisciplinary, and this course surveys insights from fields such as political science, economics, public policy, psychology, evolutionary biology and anthropology. We will define the term culture using the tools of social science and discuss questions including where culture comes from, how culture is transmitted, and how culture changes. We then examine the possible implications of culture in areas such as economic growth, public goods provision, ethnicity, and social movement. Throughout the course, will read analyses drawn from many parts of the world, particularly Asia, Africa, North America, and Europe.",
